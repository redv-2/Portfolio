        <h3>What makes a website <em>special?</em></h3>
        <p>Making a website your own requires little to no effort when left in the hands of
            a compassionate developer who loves what he does and nurtures creativity into every
            angle of his work mixed with technical prowess.<br>
            Don't settle for the standard when it comes to your website, the modern day storefront
            of the businesses of today, get a website that will pop out and keep users wanting to browse
            and learn what your business has to offer.<br>
            Why settle for any less? If you have faith in 
            your business, let your customers know that with a beautiful site to graciously introduce
            yourself to the world.

        the dark and mysterious, along with both vintage and modern designs, the possibilities are only
    limited to the client's best wishes for the design they desire. <br>
