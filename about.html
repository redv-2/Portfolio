        <h2>About me</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>My name is Curtis, I am a 20 year old full-stack web developer with a keen interest in computers and have been coding since the age of 9.
            With a GCSE in computing and multiple certificates featuring languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Visual Basic to name a few, my skills
            come in great use for all reaches of the digital world.<br>
            <br>I am interested in electronic music production, DJing, adept at using Adobe Creative tools such as photoshop and premiere pro,
            and have even made some extensive compilation videos of trips I've been on around the world.
