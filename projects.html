        <h3>This Portfolio</h3>
        <p>This very page was the <strong>most recent prototype</strong> of a couple pre-existing versions of my main site. I aim to capture the essence of a brief, descriptive website that
        shows not only technical skill but also my personality itself to anyone who may not know me. This site was initially designed on photoshop, allowing for a good wireframe to be created
        to help capture the right feel and presentation of myself for the world.<br>As I continue to learn more day by day about coding and its possibilities, I have left a trail of my growth
        by leaving my original portfolio (The first public prototype) <strong><a href="https://redv-2.github.io/CurtisJacks/">here.</a></strong> Otherwise, below is a runthrough of my original page!</p>
        <h3>My first prototype</h3>
        <div class="carousel">
            <img src="assets/images/proto_home.PNG" id="proto">
            <h4 id="prototitle">Home page.</h4>
            <input type="button" value="Next Image" id="nextproto">
        </div>
        <p>This is my first portfolio page. It was very basic and I had little understanding of essential tools such as flexbox and css grid, however for a first portfolio it was rather exciting
            to launch and call my own. Where it lacks in functionality, it gave back in character as it was my first design and I particularly enjoyed the overlayed design on my about page where
            the content would lay over one another like a stack of notes. For my current website I chose to go for a more simple design, however I am still a large fan of how I formatted my old one.<br>
            This website also featured a non-functional projects and contact page, with working buttons for my social media accounts to contact me.<br>In recent times, I have been learning how to better
            create forms and soon to learn to make a functional email submission form.
